George Hotz同学在[其blog](http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/)（[ATOM](http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)）上发布了对PS3的破解进展，不但声称发现了漏洞，昨天甚至还放出了漏洞相关的代码，看起来PS3的破解重燃希望，虽然考虑到蓝光成本、蓝光破解、游戏的超大容量等等因素，盗版游戏要泛滥依然是比较困难的，不过起码对于有兴趣玩玩homebrew的开发者来说PS3的破解还是非常有意思的。

原文如下～：

> In the interest of openness, I've decided to release the exploit. Hopefully, this will ignite the PS3 scene, and you will organize and figure out how to use this to do practical things, like the iPhone when jailbreaks were first released. I have a life to get back to and can't keep working on this all day and night.

> Please document your findings on the [psDevWiki](http://wiki.ps2dev.org/). They have been a great resource so far, and with the power this exploit gives, opens tons of new stuff to document. I'd like to see the missing HV calls filled in, nice memory maps, the boot chain better documented, and progress on a 3D GPU driver. And of course, the search for a software exploit.

> [This](http://geohot.com/ps3_exploit.zip) is the coveted PS3 exploit, gives full memory access and therefore ring 0 access from OtherOS. Enjoy your hypervisor dumps. This is known to work with version 2.4.2 only, but I imagine it works on all current versions. Maybe later I'll write up [how it works](http://pastie.org/795944) :)

利用饭后10分钟，来更新下blog～ 有空值得研究下～可惜我没有2.4.2的PS3……




以上～
