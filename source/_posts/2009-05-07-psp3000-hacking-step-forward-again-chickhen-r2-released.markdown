我早上点到[Davee's DevSite](http://davee.x-fusion.co.uk/)的时候还没有仔细看，刚才在别的网站看到说PSP3000 Homebrew（自制软件）破解了，忙上去一看，果不其然，在[昨天发布了第一个ChickHEN](http://arthraim.cn/post/2009/05/22.html)之后，ChickHEN Homebrew Enabler R2也速度发布了，点[这里](http://davee.x-fusion.co.uk/releases/ChickHENR2.rar)官方下载，另外不妨到[这里](http://www.levelup.cn/news/NewsDetails/2009-5-7/33623.shtml)看一下国人的评测，GBA,FC,CPS2,MVS模拟器都测试通过了，并且PPS和xReader这样的常用软件也可以用了。弟妹啊，恭喜你~~




来看看这一次的更新。

> [ChickHEN Revision 2] - Team Typhoon



[Changelog]

- Now supports homebrew

- Homebrew Support enhanced

- Tiff image blocking in HEN (displays unsupported)



[What it does?]

ChickHEN works as a homebrew enabler for all PSP models (1000, 2000 and 3000) and allows execution of homebrew games and apps on 5.03 Official firmware. It can allow you to play games such as Bugz!, Jellycar or run apps such as pspfiler and PSPTube. Homebrew enhances the experience of a normal PSP without any faulty side-effects.



[What it does not do?]

- Run ISO, CSO or any other form of UMD backup.

- Run PSX Games

- Touch The Flash of your beloved PSP

- Magically allow the use of Custom Firmware (on TA-088v3 or PSP 3000)

- Load plugins



[How do I use it?]

Depending on your PSP Model, you're going to need a specific tiff image. If you have a Phat (1000) PSP, use the tiff image supplied in the "PHAT" folder and copy it to ms0:/PSP/PHOTO. Else copy the tiff image in the "SLIM" folder to ms0:/PSP/PHOTO. After you've copied the image to your PSP, you can copy the h.bin supplied to the root of the memorystick (ms0:/). This should be sufficient for PSP to reboot into ChickHEN.



[Can it break my PSP?]

ChickHEN works differently to all previous HEN's. Instead of flashing to flash0, it resides entirely in RAM to prevent any damage to the system. Sure enough, you can run applications in HEN to flash stuff but I strongly recommend against it. ChickHEN comes with no warrenty, no guanantee and you run this software under your own responsibility. Flashing onto your PSP WILL BRICK IT!!



As stated, HEN comes with no warrenty, and this software should not be used in conjunction with homebrew which can countervent any copyright laws.
