![](/images/uploads/zb/taylor-swift.jpg) 听歌总是习惯一阵一阵的，有时候喜欢一个歌手了就把他的专辑从头到尾一遍一遍放一整天，有时候觉得没有什么特别在意的音乐了就把所有的歌点歌shuffle乱起八糟的放着，有时候突然爱上一首歌就循环放三四天，尽管3、4天后不见得还知道歌词 - -




这次推荐的就是[Taylor Swift](http://taylorswift.com/)的Love Story，我就不装着好像很了解她的样子了，也是听了这个歌才去google了几下子，发现不错是个美女，乡村美少女。听这首歌的时候一般在捣鼓那些恼人的项目，所以觉得很放松，歌词也是越听越有趣的那种。




**介绍：**




2006年冬天，乡村女歌手泰勒史薇芙特推出她的首支单曲，以当红乡村巨星提姆麦克罗（Tim McGraw）的名字当作标题，引起广大的注意，也打进了乡村排行前十名。看到这样一个标题，也许很多人都会直觉的以为那是一首歌颂提姆麦克罗的作品，事实上，提姆麦克罗的名字在这里只是被当作一段爱情故事里面的「书签」，唱歌的女孩子告诉心上人，当你想到提姆麦克罗的时候，我希望你想到我最喜爱的歌曲，我希望你想到我。令人惊奇的是，TS不但是歌曲的作者，她首张同名专辑里面的所有歌曲也都是她亲自参与谱写的，而当时她才十五岁。在乡村歌坛的历史上，我们曾经陆续看到过好些大放异彩的少女歌手：谭妮雅塔克（Tanya Tucker）唱红「Delta Dawn」的时候，才十三岁，玛莉奥斯蒙（Marie Osmond）以「Paper Roses」成名的时候，也是十三岁，而黎安莱姆丝（LeAnn Rimes）以「Blue」首度造成轰动的时候，同样也是十三岁。比较起来，TS的崛起似乎稍微晚了一点点，但是跟几位「前辈」们不同的是，她不必仰赖别人来帮她作曲，不但能唱，更以「创作歌手」的姿态出现，展现了相当成熟的创作才华，因此前途是非常被看好的。

> We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd

And say hello, little did I know



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go



And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story

Baby, just say yes



So I sneak out to the garden to see you

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while

Oh, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

But you were everything to me, I was begging you please don't go



And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story

Baby, just say yes

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

It's a love story

Baby, just say yes



I got tired of waiting, wondering if you were ever coming around

my faith in you was fading

When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone

I keep waiting for you but you never come

Is this in my head, I don't know what to think

he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said

Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know

I talked to your dad you'll pick out a white dress

It's a love story

Baby, just say yes



Oh, oh, oh

We were both young when I first saw you
